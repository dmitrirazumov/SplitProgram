Windows XP is a line of proprietary operating systems develo
ped by Microsoft for use on general-purpose computer systems, includ
ing home and business desktops, notebook computers, and media centers. The lett
ers "XP" stand for eXPerience.[2] Codenamed "Whistler" after Whistler, British Colum
bia, a
s many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackc
omb ski resort during its development, Windows XP is
the successor to both Windows 2000 and Windows Me, and is the firs
t consumer-oriented operating system produced by Microsoft to be built on the W
indows NT kernel and architecture. Windows XP was first released on October 25, 2001, and over 40
0 million copies are in use, according to a January 2006 estimate by an IDC analyst.[3] It is succeeded
by Windows Vista, which was released to volume license customers on No
vember 8, 2006, and worldwide to the general
public on January 30, 2007.
The most common editions of the operating system are W
indows XP Home Edition, which is targeted at home users, and Windows XP
Professional, which has additional features such as support for Windows Serve
r domains and dua
l processors, and is targeted at power users and business clients. Windows XP Me
dia Center Edition has additional multimedia features enhancing the ability
to record and watch TV shows, view DVD movies, and listen to music. Windows XP Tablet
PC Edition is designed to run the ink-aware Tablet PC pla
tform. Two separate 64-bit versions of Windows XP were also rele
ased, Windows XP 64-bit Edition for IA-64 (Itanium) processors and Windows X
P Professional x64 Edition for x86-64 processors.
Windows XP is known for its impr
oved stability and efficiency over previous version
s of Microsoft Windows. It presents a significantly redesigned graphi
cal user interface, a change Microsoft promoted as more user-friendly than pre
vious versions of Windows. New software management capabilities were introduced to avo
id the "DLL hell" that plagued older consumer versions of Windows. It is als
o the first version of Windows to use product activation to combat soft
ware piracy, a restriction that did not sit well with some users and priv
acy advocates. Windows XP has also been criticized by some users for secur
ity vulnerabilities, tight integration of applications such as In
ternet Explorer and Windows Media Player, and for aspects of its u
ser interface.
Windows XP had been in development sin
ce early 1999, when Microsoft started work
ing on Windows Neptune, an operating system inte
nded to be the "Home Edition" equivalent to Windows 200
0 Professional. It was eventually cancelled and became Wh
istler, which later became Windows XP. Many ideas f
rom Neptune and Odyssey (another cancelled Windows vers
ion) were used in Windows XP.
